# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎮 Still a grown-up kid at heart, juggling games, side projects, new tech, and work... not always gracefully, but always with passion.  
Occasionally distracted ... 🦋  
... constantly learning ... 📚  
... but always curious! 🧐  

### 💡 What's my current spotlight?
I'm currently working on 🔥 **Render Hell** 🔥  
_https://github.com/IngSorre97/Render-Hell_  

A graphical showcase, made with **Unity**, **HLSL** and *lots of pain*, currently comprise a Brush3D to spatially interact with meshes by means of **drawing regions**, **clip regions** and **extrapolating drawn regions** 

### ⌚ In a world with unlimited ~power~ time...
I would work at 🔍 **The Good Game Engine** 🔎, a custom game-engine made as an exercise-of-style with **C++**  
_https://github.com/IngSorre97/The-Good-Game-Engine_  

Main idea is to create a base following the full tutorial by _The Cherno_, and then adding a series of tools to _~enforce~ prompt_ the user to follow coding good-practices 👀
