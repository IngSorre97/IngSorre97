# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🎮 Still a grown-up kid at heart, juggling games, side projects, new tech, and work... not always gracefully, but always with passion.  
🦋 Occasionally distracted  
📚 Constantly learning  
🧐 Always curious.  

### What's my current spotlight?
I'm currently working on **Render Hell** - https://github.com/IngSorre97/Render-Hell  
A graphical showcase, made with **Unity**, **HLSL** and *lots of pain*, currently comprise a Brush3D to spatially interact with meshes by means of:  
- drawing regions
- clip regions
- 👀 _spoiler_ 👀  extrapolate drawn regions
